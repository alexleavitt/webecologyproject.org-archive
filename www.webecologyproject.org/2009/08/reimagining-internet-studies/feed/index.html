		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I find your project fascinating, and i think there is a lot of potential here. But you really say little about how ecology plays out in this expansive, digital world you are attempting to understand. When I think of ecology, I think of not only the social aspects of digitality but also their place in the natural environment. Could your group say more about how this research will actually help us understand ecological relationships on a scale that goes beyond just social analysis? It seems to me that if we want to have a deep understanding of the web, an ecological understanding, we should consider the environmental costs of these social technologies. Good stuff, keep up the good work.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s quite interesting to think of internet users as actors that are unwillingly being given a role they play without even realizing it. If I search for something online I&#039;ll find related ads and I&#039;ll click them because I&#039;m interested in what they sell. That&#039;s exactly how I&#039;m being expected to act considering why I was online in the first place. Recently I searched a few articles on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.123-reg.co.uk/email/&quot; rel=follow rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;email hosting&lt;/a&gt; because I heard it&#039;s quite cheap and an email from my domain sound better and more professional than one from a generic service. Anyway, I just wanted to read more about it and 30 minutes later I was the owner of such an email box. It seems I played my part just like I was supposed to.]]></description>
