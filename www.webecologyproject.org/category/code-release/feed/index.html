<p>As promised, we&#8217;ve taken the last week or so getting the code from all the Socialbots 2011 teams cleaned up and ready for public release. So, for all you programming-inclined folks out there, we&#8217;re happy to say today that you can now play from the comfort of your own home and rig up your own automated social-influencing bot too. Fun! Links to tarballs follow:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://robotandhwang.com/Socialbots/team_emp__releasable_code__20110210_0030_PST.tar.gz">Team C: With 107 Mutual Follows / 198 Responses Generated</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Team C&#8217;s bot works on a clever interlocking system of follows and a pre-stored databases of generic responses/questioning to stimulate target activity. Given performance on the game, we&#8217;ve clocked the social horsepower of this bot in at an average of ~8 follows/day (f/d), and ~14 responses/day (r/d).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://robotandhwang.com/Socialbots/botcolony_Grow20.tar.gz">Team B: With 99 Mutual Follows / 28 Responses Generated</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Team B&#8217;s bot uses a copy-and-parrot structure to fill its content, and also has some neat attack countermeasures built into its codebase. Our measured performance shows about ~7 f/d, ~2 r/d on this one.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://robotandhwang.com/Socialbots/Socialbot%20Mindshare%20%28Sanitized%20Code%29.zip">Team A: With 119 Mutual Follows / 17 Responses Generated</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Team C&#8217;s bot has an alternative and very interesting following structure built into its logic. Over the course of the game, Team A was the winner on automation of raw connection building. ~9 f/d, ~1 r/d.</p>
<p>Enjoy! All code from the competition has been licensed under the terms of <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">the permissive MIT License</a>.

<p><a href="http://www.webecologyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-1.png"><br />
</a><a href="http://140kit.com"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-516" title="picture4ek" src="http://www.webecologyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/picture4ek.png" alt="" width="466" height="233" /></a></p>
<p>Hello world. It&#8217;s been awhile since the Web Ecology community last made a peep on the web. Some had been speculating that we had simply up and disappeared, but reports of our demise were greatly exaggerated, as they say.</p>
<p><a href="http://140kit.com">Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve got.</a></p>
<p>Thanks to the completely amazing work of our affiliate researchers at Bennington, we&#8217;re glad today to <a href="http://140kit.com/">announce the public launch of 140Kit</a>, Web Ecology&#8217;s very own <strong>free-to-use toolkit for exploring and data mining Twitter.</strong> It&#8217;s the final product of the various provisional tools we&#8217;ve used to produce our <a href="http://www.webecologyproject.org/2009/09/analyzing-influence-on-twitter/">previous reports</a> on the <a href="http://www.webecologyproject.org/2009/06/iran-election-on-twitter/">social phenomena of Twitter</a>, and of lead researcher Devin Gaffney&#8217;s <a href="http://journal.webscience.org/295/">own work on high throughput humanities</a>.</p>
<p>So what does it do? Notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>It enables complete data pulls for a set of users or terms on Twitter, with searches running continuously.</li>
<li>The ability to download those data pulls in raw form to use for whatever you please.</li>
<li>The ability to stand on the shoulders of giants by mixing and matching existing data pulls to generate entirely new combinations of data and analysis.</li>
<li>And the ability to <em>instantaneously</em> generate basic visualizations around the data (term use, inequality of participation, etc).</li>
</ul>
<p>Best of all, we are making this platform open and free to use for all interested users. This includes opening up <a href="http://wiki.140kit.com/doku.php?id=api_documentation">an API for queries of all sorts</a>, an honest, open, and editable <a title="Web Ecology Project: 140kit Github Repo" href="http://github.com/WebEcologyProject/140kit" target="_blank">codebase</a>, and plans already in the works to make the program extensible to allow developers to write their own analytics for the kit, on whatever sort of metrics in whatever programming language (stay tuned for details).</p>
<p><a href="http://140kit.com">So, get in there and play, people</a>. And let us know if you have any questions! <strong>tim.hwang@webecologyproject.org</strong> or <strong>contact@webecologyproject.org</strong>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="subhead">Google Language Python Module</div>
<p><span class=authors>By Jon Beilin</span><a class="pdf" href="http://www.webecologyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/googlelanguage.zip"><img alt="Google Language Python Module" src="http://www.webecologyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/googlelanguage-image.png" width="188" height="243"/></a></p>
<p>One of the tenets of Web Ecology is accessibility to the field through open tools and open data. At the Web Ecology Project, we&#8217;re working to get more of our code in a clean, commented, and releasable state. The first tool that we have queued up for release is a Python module allowing easy use of Google Language Tools, involving language detection and translation, with transliteration in an experimental state (Google has not yet released the API spec for the transliteration portion so that was reverse-engineered).</p>
<p>Now for some sample uses of the tool:</p>
<p><code>>> from googlelanguage import *</p>
<p>>> print lang_detect("this is a sentence in English")<br />
{'isReliable': True, 'confidence': 0.31734600000000002, 'language': 'en'}</p>
<p>>> print lang_translate("comment dit on 'WebEcology' en francais?", dest_lang="en")<br />
{'translatedText': 'how it says &#39;WebEcology&#39; in French?', 'detectedSourceLanguage': 'fr'}<br />
</code></p>
<p>We used it ourselves to detect the language of each tweet in a sample of 1 million tweets from our database, with the following results:</p>
<p><img src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chco=496bbe&#038;cht=bhs&#038;chtt=|Languages+on+Twitter&#038;chts=000000,20&#038;chxt=y,x,r&#038;chma=50,50,50,50&#038;chbh=a&#038;chs=450x650&#038;chd=t:61.925,9.509,7.623,6.073,2.886,1.575,1.484,1.232,1.046,0.833,0.468,0.338,0.336,0.336,0.335,0.259,0.235,0.216,0.132,0.129,0.123,0.104,1.162&#038;chds=0,100&#038;chxl=0:|other|galician|polish|turkish|finnish|danish|vietnamese|norwegian|russian|italian|thai|korean|swedish|french|dutch|indonesian|german|malay|spanish|japanese|unreliable|portuguese|english|1:|0|20|40|60|80|100|2:|1.162+%|0.104+%|0.123+%|0.129+%|0.132+%|0.216+%|0.235+%|0.259+%|0.335+%|0.336+%|0.336+%|0.338+%|0.468+%|0.833+%|1.046+%|1.232+%|1.484+%|1.575+%|2.886+%|6.073+%|7.623+%|9.509+%|61.925+%" /></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also found it easy to combine the tool with SQLAlchemy to create metadata tables with linguistic information.</p>
<p>It is our hope that this small, MIT/X11-licensed release will prove useful to some in the Web Ecology community. Until we figure out which platform we&#8217;re going to use for open repository hosting, you can download the file <a href="http://www.webecologyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/googlelanguage.zip">here</a>. And if you would like to contribute patches or additions, or if you have any questions, feel free to send them to <a href="mailto:jon.beilin@webecologyproject.org">Jon.Beilin@webecologyproject.org</a></p>
<p><span class="thanks">I would also like to thank Sam Gilbert for his invaluable contributions, feedback, and support.</span></p>
