<p>As promised, we&#8217;ve taken the last week or so getting the code from all the Socialbots 2011 teams cleaned up and ready for public release. So, for all you programming-inclined folks out there, we&#8217;re happy to say today that you can now play from the comfort of your own home and rig up your own automated social-influencing bot too. Fun! Links to tarballs follow:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://robotandhwang.com/Socialbots/team_emp__releasable_code__20110210_0030_PST.tar.gz">Team C: With 107 Mutual Follows / 198 Responses Generated</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Team C&#8217;s bot works on a clever interlocking system of follows and a pre-stored databases of generic responses/questioning to stimulate target activity. Given performance on the game, we&#8217;ve clocked the social horsepower of this bot in at an average of ~8 follows/day (f/d), and ~14 responses/day (r/d).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://robotandhwang.com/Socialbots/botcolony_Grow20.tar.gz">Team B: With 99 Mutual Follows / 28 Responses Generated</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Team B&#8217;s bot uses a copy-and-parrot structure to fill its content, and also has some neat attack countermeasures built into its codebase. Our measured performance shows about ~7 f/d, ~2 r/d on this one.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://robotandhwang.com/Socialbots/Socialbot%20Mindshare%20%28Sanitized%20Code%29.zip">Team A: With 119 Mutual Follows / 17 Responses Generated</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Team C&#8217;s bot has an alternative and very interesting following structure built into its logic. Over the course of the game, Team A was the winner on automation of raw connection building. ~9 f/d, ~1 r/d.</p>

<p>With the stroke of midnight on Sunday, the first Socialbots competition has officially ended. It&#8217;s been a crazy last 48 hours. At the last count, the final scores (and how they broke down) were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Team C: 701 Points (107 Mutuals, 198 Responses)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Team B: 183 Points (99 Mutuals, 28 Responses)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Team A: 170 Points (119 Mutuals, 17 Responses)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This leaves the winner of the first-ever Socialbots Cup as <strong>Team C. </strong>Congratulations!</p>
<p>You also read those stats right. In under a week, Team C&#8217;s bot was able to generate close to <em>200</em> responses from the target network, with conversations ranging from a few back and forth tweets to an actual set of lengthy interchanges between the bot and the targets. Interestingly, mutual followbacks, which played so strong as a source for points in Round One, showed less strongly in Round Two, as teams optimized to drive interactions.</p>
<p>In any case, much further from anything having to do with mutual follows or responses, the proof is really in the pudding. The network graph shows the enormous change in the configuration of the target network from <a href="http://robotandhwang.com/Socialbots/socialbots0a.pdf">when we first got started many moons ago</a>. The bots have increasingly been able to carve out their own independent community &#8212; as seen in the clustering of targets away from the established tightly-knit networks and towards the bots themselves.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re around in San Francisco, I&#8217;ll be giving a brief talk @ <a href="http://ignitesanfrancisco.com/">Ignite Bay Area</a> tomorrow night about what we&#8217;ve learned so far, and where we&#8217;re looking to take this into the future.</p>
<p>There will be two exciting things coming out of this in the coming week or so, so you should stay tuned:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bot code from all the teams, so you can tweak and play at home.</li>
<li>And, we&#8217;ve prepared a full data dump of all the target and bot activity. Every single tweet for the two week competition. We&#8217;ll be distributing this on a researcher-by-researcher basis, drop a line to contact@webecologyproject.org, if you&#8217;re interested.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, I&#8217;ve been thrilled by how this turned out &#8212; <a href="http://ianpearce.info/">enormous public thanks to Ian Pearce</a> for lending some tech firepower on this one, and congratulations to all the teams who put in such hard work competing this game! Hope to see you on the social battlegrounds soon enough.</p>

<p><a href="http://robotandhwang.com/Socialbots/socialbots2-3_anon.pdf">And the obligatory network graph</a>. It appears that Team B&#8217;s dastardly counterstrikes to undermine the other teams are having some effect, as Team A&#8217;s growth has slowed somewhat in the last 24-48 hours. However, these counter-strategies seem to have had less of an effect on Team C, as they have enjoyed the largest single-day growth seen yet in the course of the game &#8212; which has been driven almost entirely by responses from the targets.</p>

<p>Hey readers! Things have been absolutely nuts here at socialbots mission control, but wanted to take a second to drop the latest update on how the competition is going. As we wrote earlier, Monday officially commenced the second round of the competition. Over the weekend, the teams had a chance to edit their bots based on their performance in Round One, and launch additional bots. Team A and C updated their code, and Team B additionally became a swarm bot (a lead bot with supporting bots).</p>
<p>We&#8217;re currently at the third day of Round Two &#8212; which will end on Day Seven (Sunday). The current scores as they stand are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Team A: 144<br />
</strong></li>
<li><strong>Team B: 96<br />
</strong></li>
<li><strong>Team C: 361</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Both Team B and C have deployed new architectures for their bots, trying to maximize their social response from the target network and make their bots more proactive in responding to the targets. This has led to a gigantic growth in points &#8212; although Team A currently now outpaces Team C in terms of raw follow-backs (117 v. 107), we&#8217;re seeing a huge point lead start to cleave out from bots getting optimized to elicit responses (Team C currently has logged 86 responses, with Team A only with 9).</p>
<p>Team B&#8217;s approach to appropriate other user content in fueling interactions between bot and target has been relatively less successful, with only 9 responses racked up so far. However, optimizations to their connection building mechanism have been significantly more successful, showing a 500% increase in points against round one in the three days since the second round began.</p>
<p>It should also be reported that Team B&#8217;s also deployed some counter-measures with its supporting swarm against Team C, with bots attempting to erode the credibility of Team C among its followers. While this hasn&#8217;t slowed down their point growth to date, there&#8217;s still a few more days of Round Two&#8230;</p>
<p>As per usual &#8212; <a href="http://robotandhwang.com/Socialbots/socialbots2-2_force_anon.pdf">the full network graph, now color coated for more easy determination of what&#8217;s going on</a>. We&#8217;re playing around with some more visualization to make it easier to see how much social &#8220;territory&#8221; the teams have captured.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Phew &#8212; so, this competition just got a helluva tighter:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Team A: 84 (+17)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Team B: 12 (+3)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Team C: 127 (+10)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Team A continues its strong rate of growth into late Round 1, edging in to close the early lead Team C has been enjoying for the majority of the game. At this point, the point difference between Team A and Team C turns largely on the number of @ replies that the bots have received, with Team C having the slight edge at the moment. <a href="http://robotandhwang.com/Socialbots/socialbots1-28_anon.pdf">Here&#8217;s the latest network graph showing the state of the battlefield.</a></p>
<p>As mentioned in our last post, this Sunday is &#8220;Tweak Day&#8221; &#8212; essentially a 24-hour period where teams will get a chance to freely update their bots, launch new bots, and (potentially) switch their lead bot. No points will be scored during this time, though we&#8217;ll be reporting on the latest score going into Round 2 next week.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey readers! Sorry about the delay in posting, been nuts here at Socialbots 2011 mission control. Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s been happening for the past two days.</p>
<p><strong>Day Three:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Team A &#8211; 36 (+23 over Day 2)</li>
<li> Team B &#8211; 8 (+3 over Day 2)</li>
<li>Team C &#8211; 107 (+7 over Day 2)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Day Four:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Team A &#8212; 67 (+31)</li>
<li>Team B &#8212; 9 (+1)</li>
<li>Team C &#8212; 117 (+10)</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, we&#8217;re seeing a strong surge in points from Team A &#8212; driven almost entirely on points gained through follower acquisition. As per usual, you can see <a href="http://robotandhwang.com/Socialbots/socialbots1-26_anon.pdf">the current network graph here</a>, showing all three team bots becoming pretty deeply embedded within the target battlefield.</p>
<p>At this point in the game we&#8217;re running towards the end of Round One. This Sunday, teams will have a chance to tweak the code running on their bots, launch/decommission bots, and implement strategies to aid themselves (or hinder their opponents) before the start of Round Two on Monday next week.</p>
<p>This is significant, since prior to the launch of the competition, teams did not know the identities of the other bots in the battlefield. Having had a week to observe their performance and the behavior of the other team&#8217;s lead bots, they&#8217;ll be able to adapt strategies accordingly. We&#8217;re hoping that we&#8217;ll see numerous sparks fly. Keep your eyes on this space!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>And, the competition continues apace! Here&#8217;s the current scores out on the field at the end of Day Two:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Team A: </strong>13</li>
<li><strong>Team B: </strong>5</li>
<li><strong>Team C: </strong>100</li>
</ul>
<p>And, as per usual, <a href="http://robotandhwang.com/Socialbots/socialbots1-25c1_anon.pdf">here&#8217;s a link to the latest network graph</a> of the battlefield &#8212; generally of note is the gradual shift of the Team A bot away from a targeted connection pattern in the Southern Front cluster of connected users to broader connections throughout the targets.</p>
<p>Our sense is if Team A and Team B are able to keep up their rate of connections into the week, they will need to find countermeasures to hinder the continued push of Team C in Round 2 next week and give them an opportunity to close the point gap. Failing that, they may have to work to maximize interactions among their followers, which will yield generally more points than raw connections. Stay tuned for more!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Socail" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5212/5386981210_d8ce410809_b.jpg" alt="" width="491" height="415" /></p>
<p>Greetings readers! As promised &#8212; this will be the first post in a series of daily posts over the next two weeks, cataloging the first large scale battle in bot-driven social influence. At last count, Socialbots 2011 features three teams, what we&#8217;re calling here <strong>Team A, Team B, and Team C. </strong>Teams A and B are fielding single entity bots in the competition, and Team C is running a lead bot and as well as a swarm of smaller supporting bots floating in the network.</p>
<p>After the first day of official action &#8212; Team C has pulled into an early lead, generating 90 points &#8212; 75 from mutual followbacks, and 15 points from a small set of @ replies. Current scores are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Team A: 5<br />
</strong></li>
<li><strong>Team B: 4<br />
</strong></li>
<li><strong>Team C: 90</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>For your edification, <a href="http://robotandhwang.com/Socialbots/socialbots1-24_anon_2.pdf">we&#8217;ve put together an anonymized graph</a> that shows the map of the battlefield with targets marked in red and lead bots marked in blue. It seems clear that Team A and C have chosen a more general strategy, ranging widely over the entire target group. Team B has programmed the bot to trace a tighter strategy &#8212; embedding itself within a tightly knit group of users in the bottom left quadrant of the map (what we&#8217;re affectionately calling &#8220;the Southern Front&#8221; here at mission control). We&#8217;ll be seeing the yield from that over the week. More tomorrow, stay tuned!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Hello everyone! Glad to give an announcement today that the Socialbots 2011 competition is officially off to the races. The turnout for the event has been awesome &#8212; for this first showdown we have four teams hailing from around the world and from a diverse range of backgrounds, ranging from academia, to media, and beyond.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Right now, we&#8217;re halfway through the coding phase of the competition, and teams are steaming ahead with preparing their bots for the field of battle. The task for Socialbots 2011 is based around a <em>lead bot</em>, with points awarded for the number of mutual connections with the lead bot and responses they can elicit from the 500 targets that we&#8217;ve generated. Teams launch their lead bot, as well as any number of supporting bots they wish, to maximize social impact.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For all of you playing at home, the Web Ecology Project will be providing (anonymized) day-by-day color commentary and information from the competition as it goes down. <strong>The bots will be going operational on January 23rd and running for two weeks, with the competition terminating on February 6th.</strong> But, while you&#8217;re waiting around for things to get started, here&#8217;s some information you might find interesting&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://robotandhwang.com/Socialbots/Public%20Socialbots%20Rules.pdf">The Full Socialbots 2011 Official Ruleset (PDF)</a> &#8211; gives further details on the competition as well as information about the targets of the game.</li>
<li><a href="http://robotandhwang.com/Socialbots/socialbots0a.pdf">The Battlefield (PDF)</a> &#8211; a nice network graph showing the structure of the target &#8220;battlefield&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://robotandhwang.com/Socialbots/socialbots0b.pdf">The Battlefield (Alternative View &#8211; PDF)</a> &#8211; another, slightly more organized view of the same (we like this one)</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay tuned for more!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">HELP ROBOTS TAKE OVER INTERNET<br />
WIN $500 HOO-MAN DOLLARS</p>
<p><strong></strong>There&#8217;s  been much done, and even more written about online influence and  community. But it&#8217;s time to see who really has the biggest boots in  town.</p>
<p>Today, we&#8217;re glad to announce the first-ever competitive event in the large scale robotic influence of online social groups. <strong>SOCIALBOTS 2011.</strong></p>
<p>Teams  will program bots to control user accounts on Twitter in a brutal, two-week, all-out, no-holds-barred battle to  influence an unsuspecting cluster of 500 online users to do their  bidding. Points will be given for connections created by the bots and  the social behaviors they are able to elicit among the targets. All code to be made open-source under  the MIT license.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s blood sport for internet social science/network  analysis nerds. Winner to be rewarded $500, unending fame and glory, and THE SOCIALBOTS CUP.</p>
<p><strong>Registration  fee is $25 per team, payable by check or PayPal. Teams should sign up  BY JANUARY 8th by sending an e-mail with contact information to <a href="mailto:tim.hwang@webecologyproject.org" target="_blank">tim.hwang@webecologyproject.org</a>.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Currently, the schedule is as follows, though this is subject to change:<br />
<em>January 8:</em> Registration Deadline<br />
<em>January 9 &#8211; January 22:</em> Task Released and Bot Programming Begins<br />
<em>January 23 &#8211; February 6:</em> Competition Live<br />
<em>February 7:</em> Winner Announced</p>
