<h4>Data Summary</h4>
<ul type="disc">
<li>111,741 tweets about Afghanistan and its presidential election posted between August 11, 2009 and September 9, 2009</li>
<li>11,255 tweets on August 20, 2009, the day of the election</li>
<li>29,642 users talked about Afghanistan in our dataset</li>
<li>Top 10% of tweeters contributed 65% of tweets (same as Iran Election)</li>
<li>Number of retweets for a user was not correlated to their tweeting volume (same as Iran Election)</li>
<li>483 hashtags were used at least 3 times</li>
<li>No single, dominant hashtag (differs from Iran Election)</li>
<li>3 most used hashtags: #Afghan09, #Afghanistan, and #AfghanElection</li>
</ul>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Afghan citizens went to the polls on August 20, 2009 after a controversial <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/07/AR2009030700974.html">delay recommended by Afghanistan&#8217;s Independent Election Commission</a> to allow ample time to prepare for fair and safe elections. Karzai was favored to win the election amid a large pool of contending candidates; the most serious challenge coming from former Foreign Minister of Afghanistan Abdullah Abdullah. In <a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2009/08/afghanistan-2004-results-and-2009.html">pre-election polling</a>, Abdullah gained significant momentum as election day drew nearer and other candidates dropped their campaigns.</p>
<p>In a clear reference to the protests following the June presidential election in Iran, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gH6zTk0ZvJGljIu7bpEh3P2uECEwD9A52QTO0">Abdullah&#8217;s campaign manager was quoted</a> predicting street violence if Abdullah doesn&#8217;t win. Here at the Web Ecology Project, we wondered if Twitter would play as significant a role in reporting the election as it did in Iran. In a country where mobile phone subscriptions add up to <a href="https://www.budde.com.au/Research/Afghanistan-Telecoms-Mobile-Internet-Forecasts.html">an estimated 50% of the population</a>, but <a href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/asia/af.htm">internet access was roughly 1.5%</a> at last estimate with the status of <a href="http://www.mcit.gov.af/Documents/RunningProjects/Fiber.pdf">network expansion [pdf]</a> unclear, could the available ICT infrastructure and awareness of social media prompted by the “twitter revolution” in Iran enable a similar phenomenon post-August 20?</p>

<h4>Tweets</h4>
<p>We pulled tweets from Twitter containing 42 &#8220;English&#8221; search terms:</p>
<table class="table" width="100%">

<p></p>
<p>Using these search terms, we have archived 111,741 tweets posted between 11:00pm EDT on August 11 and 11:00pm EDT on September 9, including a complete set of 11,255 tweets from the day of the election. Currently, our dataset is noisy; we are aware of complications with the common name &#8220;Abdullah&#8221; in its different forms as well as the presence of the Taliban in Pakistan. We believe that about 10,000 tweets are affected by such irregularities while we improve our filter.</p>
<p>(We also compiled a list of Dari and Pashto search terms that correspond with our English search terms. These have yielded only 3389 tweets over the same time period, 33 of which were also picked up by the English equivalents. More work still needs to be done to prepare this corpus for analysis.)</p>
<p>Using the tools we first developed for our report <em><a href="http://www.webecologyproject.org/2009/06/iran-election-on-twitter/">The Iran Election on Twitter</a></em>, we have generated a timeline of volume of tweets pulled using the English search terms over the four weeks of data collection; data points are at one hour increments [click for larger view].</p>
<p><a href="http://www.webecologyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/af.jpg"><img src="http://www.webecologyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/af_thumb.png" alt="Afghan Tweet Volume over Time (click for larger)"/></a></p>
<p>Adjusted for time difference, August 20, election day, saw the most activity on twitter&mdash;over 10% of all tweets across our 28-day dataset. The spike on that day begins between 10:00pm and 11:00pm EDT (UTC-4:00) on August 19, which coincides with the opening of polls in Afghanistan at 7:00am AFT (UTC+4:30), August 20. The second largest spike on the graph occurs on August 15, which was the date the Taliban bombed the UN Headquarters in Kabul.</p>
<h4>Users</h4>
<p>Our dataset involves 29,642 users, making an aggregate rate of 3.76 tweets per user. Using a Lorenz curve [plotted below], we found a pattern of unequal distribution of Twitter activity across the user population that was similar to our findings for the Iran Election.</p>

<p>The steepness of the above curve illustrates that the top 10% of users contributed 65.3% of all tweets, which is almost identical to the distribution found for the Iran Election tweets (the top 10% of users contributed 65.5% of all tweets). Another finding similar to our Iran study is the disconnect between a user&#8217;s number of tweets and the number of times they were retweeted. (Our list of retweets only account for tweets that contained either upper or lower case forms of &#8220;RT&#8221;, with any form of punctuation, then followed by any number of spaces and @<em>user</em>.)</p>
<p><iframe width='500' height='300' frameborder='0' src='http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=t8h2cWXvvFooQLfePX3KCsw&#038;output=html&#038;widget=true'></iframe></p>
<p>The top tweeters on Afghanistan are more heterogeneous in their affiliations than the the top retweeted users. A number of high profile news organizations, individual journalists, and official and semi-official military channels comprise the list of top retweeted users. Notable accounts are those of the <a href="http://www.pajhwok.com/">Pajhwok Afghan News</a> (@pajhwok) and the <a href="http://www.aliveinafghanistan.org/">Alive in Afghanistan</a> project (@aliveinafghan), as well as the latter&#8217;s founder Brian Conley (@BaghdadBrian) of <a href="http://smallworldnews.tv/">Small World News</a> (@smallworldnews). These accounts are the strongest &#8220;local&#8221; voices offering Afghan perspectives on events. In the same way that individuals with close affiliations in Iran were both prolific and influential sources of information, these represent similar sources for Afghanistan.</p>
<h4>Hashtags</h4>
<p>One significant difference between Iran and Afghanistan is the lack of a common hashtag like #iranelection. Although multiple top hashtags were often used in tandem, only recently has #Afghan09 shown more dominance. The pie chart below shows the usage of the most common hashtags as a percentage of all tweets containing a hashtag.</p>
<p><img src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chma=50,50,50,50&#038;chbh=60,10,5&#038;chs=500x300&#038;chd=t:25.6,25.1,13,8.6,4,22.6&#038;chds=0,100&#038;chco=2D5F1A&#038;cht=p&#038;chtt=|Afghan+Hashtags&#038;chts=000000,20&#038;&#038;chl=afghan09+%2825.6%%29|afghanistan+%2825.1%%29|afghanelection+%2813%%29|news+%288.6%%29|militarymon+%284%%29|other+%2822.6%%29&#038;chp=3.1" alt="Afghan Hashtags"/></p>
<p>Out of the 483 different hashtags used at least three times, #Afghan09 was most prominent, first adopted by @aliveinafghan, @smallworldnews, and @BaghdadBrian. #Afghanistan (a non-unique hashtag) had the next highest frequency, followed by #AfghanElection, originally adopted by @pajhwok. Additionally, the extremely generic #news and <a href="http://wthashtag.com/Militarymon">support our troops</a> hashtag #militarymon were used often. Important to note is that the #Afghan09</p>
<h4>Next Steps for this Research</h4>
<p>Although no protests have ensued, Twitter activity has been kept alive by regular <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f3a03082-9cd7-11de-ab58-00144feabdc0.html">reports of official vote counts and allegations of voter fraud</a>&mdash;spiking a more consistent conversation about the war. The statistics in this post are based on all aggregated tweets captured using English search terms over 4 weeks worth of activity. The next step in this project is to analyze the evolution of the conversation and its key players over time. We have broken down the usage of hashtags, the volume of tweets per user, and retweets, per day. We will be studying how the ranks of the top users in terms of output and “influence” have changed since the election day. Beyond quantitative analysis, this effort will require a qualitative classification of users to better understand the nature of the user population (Daniel Bennett&#8217;s <a href="http://frontlineclub.com/blogs/danielbennett/2009/08/tweeting-from-afghanistan.html">&#8220;Who to follow: Twitter for the Afghanistan election&#8221;</a> offers a good starting point). We hope to analyze the Dari and Pashto tweets in the same manner.</p>
<p>The need for a more detailed study of the conversations on Twitter is exemplified by Stephen Colbert (@StephenAtHome) and his <a href="http://twitter.com/StephenAtHome/status/3451289324">single tweet</a> on the Afghan election, which received enough retweets to elevate him to the 38th most retweeted user in our dataset:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;despite rumors of voter fraud in afghanistan, it looks like it went smoothly for new afghan president-elect mahmoud ahmadinejad.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Expect a full report on this soon, as well as a much anticipated follow-up to our Iran Election report after that! Please <a href="../../contact">send us your feedback</a> on the progress of this research and ideas for other ways to analyze and interpret these data.</p>

<p><a class="pdf" href="http://www.webecologyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/influence-report-final.pdf"><img alt="Analyzing Influence on Twitter" src="http://www.webecologyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/frontpage-influence.jpg" width="188" height="243"/></a><span class="authors">By Alex Leavitt<br/>with Evan Burchard, David Fisher, &#038; Sam Gilbert</span></p>
<p>Using a new methodology based on the content and responses of 12 popular users, we determined measurements of relative influence on Twitter. We examined an ecosystem of 134,654 tweets, 15,866,629 followers, and 899,773 followees, and in response to the 2,143 tweets generated by these 12 users over a 10-day period, we collected 90,130 responses published by other users.</p>
<p>            <em>Summary of Findings</em></p>
<p>An analysis of our methodology and statistics suggests that on Twitter, among various configurable conclusions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><i>mashable</i> is more influential than <i>CNN</i>.</li>
<li><i>sockington</i> is more influential than <i>MCHammer</i>, while <i>MCHammer</i> is more influential than three major social media analysts (<i>garyvee</i>, <i>Scobleizer</i>, and <i>chrisbrogan</i>). </li>
<li>Celebrities with higher follower totals (eg., <i>THE_REAL_SHAQ</i> and <i>ijustine</i>) foster more conversation than provide retweetable content. </li>
<li>News outlets, regardless of follower count, influence large amounts of followers to republish their content to other users.</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Folly of Following Followers: Judging Influence on Twitter</h4>
<p>As a simple online platform for conversation, Twitter is an ideal  an ecological system through which we can understand the relationship between users and their environments on the Web. Especially compared to other social networks, Twitter simplifies most of the extraneous features and boils down its environment to people and content. The unusual simplicity of Twitter, though, continues to warp perception of how the relationship between user and platform operates. Many of the popularized studies examining influence on Twitter fail to identify the nuances of social interaction in the system. While attempts have been made (eg., <a href="http://twinfluence.com/about.php " target="_blank">http://twinfluence.com/about.php</a>), the analyses tend to focus on the connections between users rather than the relationship of users, content, and platform. This report therefore aims to supplement previous investigations of the Twitter environment with more comprehensive data sets to enhance new approaches to understanding the concept of &#8220;influence&#8221; on social networks.</p>
<p>A focus solely on the connections between users skews an understanding of how influence operates and flows on Twitter. A popular metric of <i>perceived</i> influence on Twitter measures the quantity of a user&#8217;s followers. In general, the more followers a user possess, the more impact he appears to make in the Twitter environment, because he seems more popular (namely, that users follow him). This statement makes sense assuming that Twitter acts as a successful broadcast medium, where a user publishes a tweet and it is read by every follower. However, this view of Twitter as a broadcast medium ignores the potential for users to interact with the content on the platform.</p>
<p>A similar and equally popular metric to measure influence on Twitter relies on the ratio between the number of a user&#8217;s followers and the number of other people that the user follows (his audience, or as we designate in this report, followees). This ratio, while better than the former method of counting followers, is still imprecise. Again, a ratio based on audience ignores the ability for a user to interact with content on the platform. However, the ratio of followers to followees does inform a better understanding of how influence can operate in Twitter&#8217;s environment.</p>
<p>The ratio of followers to followees may communicate the intended purpose or emergent practices of a user. For example, if the ratio approaches infinity (high follower total versus low followee total), the user account might be described as focusing on the material aspect of Twitter. By material, we mean a compulsion toward moving content to other users in the environment. In another instance, if the ratio approaches 1 (an equal or near-equal amount of followers and followees), the user might be categorized as a conversationalist. The user most likely follows back a majority of his followers, to retain familiarity with more personal conversations. Contrarily, the materialistic user aims to collect followers as contacts to whom the user may push content (who may then share the same content with other users). Finally, if the ratio approaches zero (low follower total versus high followee total), we might categorize the user as a spammer. As an emergent behavior, the stereotypical spammer attempts to collect users with the intent to push content to as many people as possible after achieving a high follower tally. However, most contemporary users can spot the stereotypical behavior of a spammer or bot, resulting in the low follower total on the spammer&#8217;s account.</p>
<p>While the follower to followee ratio does not represent an accurate measurement of influence on Twitter, the ratio does inform the community to types of users. Before we apply these types to our understanding of online influence, we must first define influence.</p>
<h4>Defining Influence on Twitter</h4>
<p>An attempt to define a universal concept of influence on the Web remains difficult, because we must account for the variations of platforms, fluidity of environments, and evolving behaviors of users online. Because each platform is different, this report will rely on a definition of online influence specific to the environment of Twitter. Therefore, we define influence on Twitter as <i>the potential of an action of a user to initiate a further action by another user</i>. The term user is defined by Twitter&#8217;s platform. The term action deserves further explanation.</p>
<p>Understanding the term action as it relates to influence on Twitter depends on the fundamental structure of ideas in the environment and how these ideas move. The fundamental unit of content on Twitter is the tweet (a user may type up to 140 characters and publish them to the web interface), so an action on Twitter comprises all interactions of a user and that unit of content (tweet). While we can analyze various types of influential actions (eg., a view on YouTube or a like on Facebook), this report will primarily focus on actions specific to Twitter. Our analysis of influence on Twitter, then, relies on the understanding of how actions shape behavior on the platform.</p>
<h4>Influence as Actions; Actions as Responses</h4>
<p>While actions on Twitter comprise both those interactions recognized by the platform as well as unexpected emergent behaviors that become widely used by users, Twitter recognizes two actions intrinsic to the system that can occur: the reply and the retweet.</p>
<p><em>Reply</em>: @username {content}<br />Example:<br /><em>@chrisbrogan Thanks for this.  I&#8217;m new to twitter and it was really helpful</em><br />Digitaltonto (on 2009-08-15 at 00:47:17)</p>
<p><em>Retweet</em>: RT @username {content}<br /><em>RT @aplusk great article thank U RT @Morgan_Johnston: this great article on health care by Whole Foods cofounder/CEO</em><br />cheerok (on 2009-08-15 at 00:31:10)</p>
<p>The reply and retweet are categorized as actions because they are applied by a user to a piece of content. The reply acts as a response to another user&#8217;s tweet using new content, while the retweet operates as a citation or paraphrase of another user&#8217;s previous content. While both actions have different purposes, both are meant to move content to other users (albeit in differing ways). If a reply or retweet exists with respect to a given tweet, the actions are evidence for influence that has occurred. A reply occurs because a user is influenced to reply to the content; a retweet occurs because a user is influenced to reproduce the content. Literally, the actions are markers of influence.</p>
<p>Two other actions that appear frequently on Twitter, extrinsic to the system yet popular enough to have become adopted by users, require explanation: the mention and the attribution.</p>
<p><em>Mention</em>: {content} @username ({content})<br /><em>Watching @BarackObama speak in Colorado on @CNN</em><br />RareAir24 (on 2009-08-15 at 19:08:51)</p>
<p><em>Attribution</em>: {content} via @username ({content})<br /><em>Fire at Kuwaiti wedding kills dozens, official media says http://bit.ly/wn95A (via @cnnbrk)</em><br />ChilliGaz (on 2009-08-15 at 19:40:18)</p>
<p>Similar to the reply and the retweet, the mention and the attribution are categorized as actions because they too are applied by a user to a piece of content. We have separated the mention and the attribution from the more fundamental reply and retweet because the former two actions are not officially recognized by the Twitter platform. In fact, a mention is similar to a reply, except a mention occurs at some point in the tweet other than at the beginning. Comparably, an attribution is similar to a retweet, except an attribution borrows the symbology of the reply to provide a citation for previously published content. We must also note here that, first, while we distinguish the attribution from the mention, we have calculated them from the same database query. Any measurement in this report of mentions also encapsulates attributions; however, we will distinguish the attribution as separate from the mention later in the paper (by tallying it alongside retweets in certain equations). Second, since mentions theoretically serve the purpose of replies, and attributions the purpose of retweets, we have not expounded upon their use in the explanation of influence in the following paragraphs. However, we can hypothesize that the applications of replies include mentions and the applications of retweets include attributions.</p>
<h4>Categorizing Actions: Conversation &amp; Content</h4>
<p>In the second-to-previous paragraph, we hint at a similar categorization for actions that we previously applied to users. Given two probable types of users, one focused on conversation and another on content, we can map these classifications to actions &#8212; replies and retweets, respectively &#8212; to explain how the relationship between users of and the actions on a platform shapes influence on Twitter. The purpose of replies assumes that a conversation is the intended goal of the action. In writing a reply, the user has been influenced to respond to a previous unit of content published by another user. Similarly, with a retweet (the objective of which is to push content), the user has been influenced by a previous user&#8217;s content to reproduce the content for other users to view. In basic terms, we can see the reply as talking back to the first user and the retweet as passing on content to a third user. However, when assigning values of influence to these types of actions, we do not give preference to one or the other.</p>
<p>Previously, we examined two possible approaches to measuring influence on Twitter: 1) counting the total number of followers a user possesses, and 2) calculating the ratio of a user&#8217;s followers to a user&#8217;s followees. These two approaches still ignore the relationship between the user, the content, and the platform. The goal of this report is to move beyond these basic assertions about influence by analyzing a comprehensive set of replies, retweets, and other actions on Twitter that act as evidence for the influential potential of users.</p>
<h4>Understanding Influence with New Data</h4>
<p>For this report, we gathered relevant data from 12 Twitter users for 10 days, between 12:00 am 15 August 2009 and 12:00 am 25 August 2009. We focused on a small number of celebrities, news outlets, and social media analysts widely perceived to be among the more influential users on Twitter. Based on the content and connections of these 12 users, we examined a total of 134,654 tweets, 15,866,629 followers, and 899,773 followees. In response to the 2,143 tweets generated by these 12 users of the 10 day period, we collected 90,130 responses (actions) published by other users (which equates to 87,987 more messages than total original tweets, or a total average of 42 responses per tweet).</p>
<p>We have listed the 12 users below, categorized into three distinct groups that we feel ultimately represent the user types previously discussed. We have also calculated the total number of tweets published by each user, the total number of each users&#8217; followers, and the total number of users that each of our 12 users follows. These statistics were updated between 28 August 2009 and 30 August 2009, so they may not necessarily reflect the exact number of tweets, followers, and followees present during the 10-day window that our data encompasses.</p>

<p>The above table has been arranged in decreasing order by total followers, based on the three distinct categories of users. These categories reveal certain resemblances to aspects of content user types and conversation user types. Generally, news outlets aim to push content, social media analysts strive to perpetuate conversations, and celebrities tend to do both (dependent on their personal practices and the community who follow them). While there are some anomalies (eg., BarackObama), most news outlets have a higher follower to followee ratio (materialistic) while most analysts have a more-equal follower-to-followee ratio (conversationalist). For celebrities, the ratio appears to favor a materialistic purpose on Twitter, but the responses generated by celebrities favor the conversationalist type.</p>
<p>In the graph below, we present a comprehensive diagram of total follow count, to reemphasize the perceived influence that each user projects. Keep in mind that although Robert Scoble (Scobleizer, ranked 12th) appears unimportant compared to Ashton Kutcher (aplusk, ranked 1st), Scoble still retains a high level of perceived influence across the entirety of Twitter, since his total number of followers amounts to over 94,000 (compared to many users that have between 50 and 1,000 followers).</p>

<h4>Influence According to Audience Response</h4>
<p>Followers, as stated before, cannot account for a reliable measurement of influence on Twitter. Instead, we must take into account the markers of influence &#8212; replies, retweets, mentions, and attributions &#8212; to inform which user holds more sway over his followers. The graph below measures the percentage of replies, retweets, and mentions per user, based on the total number of responses respective to each user. </p>

<p>Of course, the graph above does not visually portray an accurate instance of influence, because the values are not weighted. Instead, the graph illustrates the relationship between responses by each user&#8217;s follower network. Therefore, to further examine the effects that followers have on influence, we present the following two graphs that measure the average number of responses in relation to followers.</p>
<p>In the following diagrams, we have utilized the concepts of content and conversation to create equations for calculating new measurements of influence. We have defined conversation-related responses as the total number of replies added to the total number of mentions (@r+@m), and we have defined content-related responses as the total number of retweets added to the total number of attributions (@RT+@via). The graphs below utilize the equations &#8220;content/followers&#8221; and &#8220;conversation/followers&#8221; to illustrate the average number of responses per follower of each of the 12 designated users.</p>

<p>The two graphs above present an interesting theory, in that the social media analysts appear to dominate both realms of content and conversation, thanks to their follower network. CNN and Mashable.com also appear high on the list of users that are able to interact well with their followers as well as push content easily to others.</p>
<p>While the above diagrams suggest that a user&#8217;s audience impacts how ideas move around said user to a large extent, these graphs do not take into account the tweets created by our 12 users, especially in relation to the responses the tweets generate. Returning to the graph representing the percentage of all responses, this illustration of influence is not entirely accurate because it does not account for the relative amount of content produced. This is especially important since the original tweets are the influencers that inspire replies, retweets, etc. Below, we present the same percentages of responses in a graph that weighs the comparison of responses against the total number of responses of other users.</p>

<p>The weighted graph above illustrates a significantly different measurement of influence than the previous diagram. If we were to state that influence is dictated by how many responses are generated, then we could certainly argue that Mashable.com is more influential than CNN Breaking News &#8212; a bold statement, especially when more than twice as many users follow cnnbrk than follow mashable. However, the weighted response statistics above must be compared to the amount of original tweets that inspired response. We have provided these statistics in the graph below:</p>
<p>            <a href="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=bhs&amp;chd=t:8.22,1.22,1.56,1.89,22.33,12.78,2.78,47.56,7.67,7.11,96.67,28.33&amp;chxt=x,y,r&amp;chxl=0:|0|900|1:|Scobleizer|chrisbrogan|CNN+|ijustine|garyvee|sockington|MCHammer|mashable|THE_REAL_SHAQ|BarackObama|cnnbrk|aplusk|2:|255|870|64|69|428|25|115|201|17|14|11|74&amp;chtt=Total+Number+of+Original+Tweets+Per+User&amp;chco=E00000&amp;chs=500x400&#xA;            "><img src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=bhs&amp;chd=t:8.22,1.22,1.56,1.89,22.33,12.78,2.78,47.56,7.67,7.11,96.67,28.33&amp;chxt=x,y,r&amp;chxl=0:|0|900|1:|Scobleizer|chrisbrogan|CNN+|ijustine|garyvee|sockington|MCHammer|mashable|THE_REAL_SHAQ|BarackObama|cnnbrk|aplusk|2:|255|870|64|69|428|25|115|201|17|14|11|74&amp;chtt=Total+Number+of+Original+Tweets+Per+User&amp;chco=E00000&amp;chs=500x400&#xA;            " alt="Total Number of Original Tweets per User" width="" height=""/></a><br/></p>
<p>The relationship between the original tweet and any subsequent responses certainly matters. For example, even though mashable and aplusk boast similar amounts of reactions (with a difference of 1620 in favor of mashable), mashable originated more than 2.5 times as many original tweets to influence those responses. Therefore, aplusk exerted less effort to achieve near-similar success. Similarly, BarackObama genereated more than 3 times as many responses in the ten-day period than did MCHammer; however, MCHammer originated over 8 times as many original tweets, meaning that the much larger effort he exerted was ultimately not as influential as the effort by BarackObama.</p>
<p>We have addressed the problematic relationship of original tweets and responses by averaging the statistics in the graphs below. The graphs utilize the equations &#8220;conversation/tweets&#8221; (@r+@m/tweets) and &#8220;content/tweets&#8221; (@RT+@via/tweets):</p>

<p>The measurement of influence reflected in these graphs most likely approaches the most accurate estimation of influence detailed in this report. To affirm this statement, we must return to our Twitter-specific definition of influence online: the potential of an action of a user to initiate a further action by another user. The two graphs above account for the responses (further actions) in relation to original tweets (actions with potential), while still theoretically accounting for the size of each user&#8217;s audience. Still, these graphs do not account for the network of the 12 users&#8217; followers, and as such remain significantly different from the previous graphs depicting average response per 1,000 followers. The optimal situation of maximum influence would account for the most followers possible executing the most actions. However, it is entirely possible that one follower published all of the responses for a given user. </p>
<p>What, therefore, do the discrepencies between original tweets and followers tell us about the data? In the previous follower graphs, social media analysts held most of the top ranks. Contrarily, in the tweet graphs, they make up the last three spots in both graphs. On average, the data suggest that social media analysts receive minimal reward for the effort they exert in maintaining a conversation with their followers. For those users that succeed, most news outlets were more successful at having their content pushed to other users. Celebrities, on the other hand, appear to inspire conversational responses with their followers, yet with more success than the analysts.</p>
<p>These graphs suggest many statements based on various relationships of users, data, and platform. However, although the graphs above represent relative influence among the 12 users, by no means do these diagrams suggest that those ranked last are not influential. For the most part, a general user on Twitter tends to depend heavily on perceived influence, whether it be total number of followers or the ratio of followers to followees. This report, though, attempts to move beyond simple assertions of influence to create a better study of influence on Twitter, supported by new approaches and quantitative data.</p>
<h4>Future Approaches for Influence Analysis</h4>
<p>This report strives to influence other researchers to pursue influence analysis based not solely on followers but also on the relationship between followers and content, and the interaction of both in Twitter&#8217;s system. Although we analyze how actions (responses to a user) represent the influence of a user, our study is limited by sample size, time range, and the ability to collect data. For instance, we hope in the future to develop a more complex algorithm that accounts for the combined influence of both followers and responses. We were not able to calculate user growth rate nor measure the number of responses per exact original tweet. Also, given that this report studies influence on Twitter, we cannot account for any external influence with respect to each user in our sample.</p>
<p>Though we admit our limitations, along with this report we are publishing a comprehensive visualization that marks each original tweet and each response (reply, retweet, and mention) along our 10-day timeline. The graph specifically shows density as a factor of influence over time for the 2,143 original tweets and 90,130 responses related to our dozen users. While our graph does not provides labels for tweet, time, etc., we encourage individual exploration of the data presented in the visualization. </p>
<p>            <a href="http://www.webecologyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sparkline1.jpeg"><img src="http://www.webecologyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sparkline1.jpeg" alt="Sparkline One" width="" height=""/></a><br/><br />

<p>The density of data varies considerably per user and per tweet. While we cannot assign each reply, retweet, and mention to a specific original tweet, we can at least determine certain patterns of density per any given tweet. The two excerpts above reflect the difference in density of responses that a certain tweet might generate. By tracking the density of responses over time, we hope to inspire further research into models of influence and web ecology as a whole.</p>

<p class="first">When deciding whether someone is worth following or talking to on Twitter, most of us make a snap judgment based on a user&#8217;s follower count, but what does this really tell us?</p>
<p>For our fourth publication, the Web Ecology Project decided to move beyond follower count to find a better way to measure influence on Twitter. Focusing in on a handful of celebrities, news outlets, and social media experts widely perceived to be among the Twitter elite, we looked at the extent to which each of these users can:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Spread content through twitter by generating Retweets and Via&#8217;s</li>
<li>Foster conversation by generating @s and Replies</li>
</ul>
<p>The results, taken from 10 days of Twitter activity (August 15th through August 24th), were surprising. Consider how the users we looked at rank by follower count:
<p>
<img src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chma=50,50,50,50&#038;chbh=a&#038;chs=500x300&#038;chd=t:3407385,2712530,2092541,2018016,1363510,1331797,1089984,862790,605441,193625,94715,94295&#038;chds=0,3500000&#038;chco=E00000&#038;cht=bhs&#038;chtt=|Followers&#038;chts=000000,20&#038;chxt=x,y&#038;chxl=0:|0|.5m|1m|1.5m|2m|2.5m|3m|3.5m|1:|Scobleizer|chrisbrogan|CNN|ijustine|garyvee|sockington|MCHammer|mashable|BarackObama|THE_REAL_SHAQ|cnnbrk|aplusk" alt="Follower Rankings"/></p>
<p>When you look at the extent to which any given tweet can spread content or foster conversation, these rankings change significantly:
<p>
<img src=http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chma=50,50,50,50&#038;chbh=a&#038;chs=500x300&#038;chd=t:72.45454545,47.55223881,36.78571429,22.64864865,22.23529412,20.390625,4.12,2.333333333,2.304347826,1.701960784,1.431034483,0.829439252&#038;chds=0,80&#038;chco=E00000&#038;cht=bhs&#038;chtt=|Avg.%20Content%20Spread%20Per%20Tweet&#038;chts=000000,20&#038;chxt=x,y&#038;chxl=0:|0|10|20|30|40|50|60|70|80|1:|garyvee|chrisbrogan|Scobleizer|MCHammer|ijustine|sockington|CNN|THE_REAL_SHAQ|aplusk|BarackObama|mashable|cnnbrk|" alt="average content spread per tweet"/><br />

<p>iJustine, for example, can spread more content than MCHammer, who has over twice as many followers, and in terms of generating conversation celebrities like THE_REAL_SHAQ and aplusk tower dominate news outlets and social media experts alike. </p>
<p>When you look at how much each of these users is able to generate conversation and spread content relative to their follower counts, however, the rankings shift even more dramatically:</p>
<p><img src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chma=50,50,50,50&#038;chbh=a&#038;chs=500x300&#038;chd=t:13.14469725,7.009849579,6.73983215,4.602577019,0.4918728,0.411455858,0.293821635,0.265921865,0.255201148,0.198979274,0.180641622,0.0944968&#038;chds=0,14&#038;chco=E00000&#038;cht=bhs&#038;chtt=|Avg.%20Content%20Spread%20Per%201,000%20Followers&#038;chts=000000,20&#038;chxt=x,y&#038;chxl=0:|0|2|4|6|8|10|12|14|1:|sockington|THE_REAL_SHAQ|MCHammer|BarackObama|ijustine|cnnbrk|garyvee|aplusk|Scobleizer|CNN|mashable|chrisbrogan|" alt="average content spread per 1000 followers"/><br />

<p>Values for MCHammer, aplusk, THE_REAL_SHAQ and CNNbrk plummet, while the social media experts, especially Chris Brogan, become powerful players. </p>
<p>These figures are just a taste of what&#8217;s to come.  In our full report, we’ll unpack these numbers further and explore the somewhat surprising nuances and types of influence on Twitter.</p>
